Background
==========

The SADC Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (SACREEE) in collaboration with the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB), Blue Marble Analytics, the Nature Conservancy, and the University of Cape Town with funding from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) of the Government of the United Kingdom is leading a project to develop “Renewable Energy Decision Support (REDS) Tools and Optimal Energy Pathways for Southern Africa.”

SACREEE and UCSB will host a two-day technical workshop from 25-26 October 2022 to introduce the GridPath electricity system model for Southern Africa (GridPath-SAPP). This is the second technical workshop. The first one was conducted online in June 2022. The target audience for the workshop includes system planning engineers and energy analysts from System Planners, Utilities, Academia, and Research Organizations.

Experience in electricity system planning is essential for participation in this workshop. Experience with the Python programming language, SQL databases, and linear optimization is desirable. Attendance at the first technical workshop is not essential.

SACREEE and UCSB will then host a two-day high level workshop from 27-28 October 2022 to present the results of the Optimal Energy Pathways for Southern Africa’s Electricity System project. Several models were developed to examine the impacts of climate change and biodiversity and socio-economic constraints on the Southern African electricity system. The target audience for the workshop includes system planning engineers and energy analysts from System Planners, Utilities, Academia, and Research Organizations, as well as River Basin Organizations.


Description of project
======================

The REDS project identifies renewable energy resources and grid integration strategies that are specific to the challenges, needs, and opportunities in Southern African countries, specifically the 12 mainland countries of the SADC region, and as coordinating member countries of the regional Southern African Power Pool (SAPP). The project has the following objectives:

1. Identify developable solar photovoltaic and wind resources that reflect the SAPP country-specific technical, economic, environmental, and social constraints and opportunities using the best available country-specific datasets in a consistent site suitability and site prioritization framework that incorporates multiple decision criteria (i.e., Multi-criteria Analysis for Planning Renewable Energy (MapRE) tools)

2. Understand the effects of potential renewable energy generation on future capacity investments and system operations in the SAPP region and identify strategies to effectively manage renewable generation variability using results from the site suitability and prioritization analysis (from objective 2), the best available cost assumptions, and an open source capacity expansion production cost model (i.e., GridPath)

3. Understand the technical and economic impacts of greater biodiversity protection and climate change on hydropower, thermal power, and wind and solar resources, and the overall Southern African electricity system.

4. Overall, increase the efficiency of planning and implementation of renewable energy projects through the design of accessible and transparent decision-support tools that support regional energy trade and allow more stakeholders to participate and provide input in power sector planning

5. Renewable energy decision support tools and models


As part of the REDS project, the team developed the GridPath model for Southern Africa, which is the focus of this workshop. GridPath is an open-source, python-based, electricity system modeling platform developed by Blue Marble Analytics and UCSB. The GridPath-SAPP model is an open-source, 12-node, multi-year, hourly resolution model with several hundred wind and solar zones, inter-regional transmission, and conventional, hydropower, and storage infrastructure. The model is modular and can be reconfigured based on user needs.
